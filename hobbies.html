    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Badminton - I'm very fond of the sport and have been playing it for
        approximately 2 years. My older brother had introduced me to the sport
        and I had heavily enjoyed playing the sport and the competitive nature
        of it. It also tested my reflexes and my fast reaction speed, whilst
        constantly working muscles throughout my whole body, also making it a
        worthwhile exercise.

      <br />
      <li>
        CSS - I lovecoding in CSS because I get to copy and detail things
        extremely accurately which gives me a joy that I unconsciously feel
        whilst coding, acting as my motivation and allowing me to constantly
        keep coding in CSS. There's so much you can do with it and it really
        helps to release my creativity and explore even more into designing
        things.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Gaming - A lot of people love gaming simply because they envision it as
        the idea of 'fun'. I also see it as fun but theres also that slight
        enjoyment of competitiveness whenever you're playing against someone or
        trying to beat a score of some sort. I'm sure you could pick up that I
        have a tendency to enjoy a competitive environment. And thats one of the
        reasons I enjoy gaming so much, because there are so many people who are
        better than me so I constantly want to improve to become beter than
        them. Just as I'll thrive in life to aspire to be better than those at
        the top by slowly making myself better at something.

        This is a slightly weird hobby but I love trying to learn new skills and
        sometimes I won't be able to do them but I love the thought of being
        able to try so many things.
